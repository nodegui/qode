# qode

qode is a fork of Node.js that replaces its event loop with Qt's event loop,
it is designed to be used together with `@nodegui/nodegui` the NodeGUI library

## Changes to Node.js

- The event loop is replaced with QT's GUI message loop.
- The process will quit when **BOTH** the QT message loop and Node.js event
  loop have quit. So if there are still Node.js requests pending, the process
  will wait until all of them have finished.
- There are new `process.versions.qode` property added - This mentions the qode version.
- There are new `process.versions.qt(runtime)` property added - This mentions the version of qt shared library you are using on runtime.
- There are new `process.versions.qt(compiled)` property added - This mentions the version of qt used while compiling qode. Ideally both runtime and compile time versions should be same but binary compatible versions could work too.
- The `process.stdin` is not supposed to work.
- On Windows the executable uses `WINDOWS` subsystem instead of `CONSOLE`
  subsystem, so unlike Node.js there is no console attached and REPL won't
  work.

## For linux

### Cloning this repo:

- Do a git clone this repo

### Install GTK headers:

- sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev

### Installing QT:

- Download qt from: https://www.qt.io/offline-installers (Preferably 5.12.x version)
- chmod a+x qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.4.run
- ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.4.run
- Click Next -> I accept checkbox and then Skip.
- Make sure you note down the install path. Also make sure there are no spaces in the path.
- From the list to choose components: - Check Desktop gcc 64bit - Qt Creator (Optional)
- Choose LGPL license and install.

### Building Qode:

- `QT_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_qt_install_dir>/5.12.4/gcc_64 node build.js`

### Common errors:

1. if you get an error similar to:

   ```
   ../../src/qode.h:5:10: fatal error: QApplication: No such file or directory
   #include <QApplication>
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ```

   Make sure you have installed QT5 and have specified the correct path in QT_INSTALL_DIR as mentioned above

2. if you get an error similar to:

   ```
    fatal error: gtk/gtk.h: No such file or directory
    #include <gtk/gtk.h>
   ```

   Make sure you have installed gtk headers as mentioned above.

3. If you get an error similar to:
   ./qode: error while loading shared libraries: libQt5Core.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.

   Check the shared libraries used by qode by running `ldd ./qode`. Then you can provide the path where qode could find the libraries like this:

   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_qt5_installation>/5.12.4/gcc_64/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./qode`

And make sure you have installed gtk3 headers also for time being.
Make sure you add LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path to qt and then run the built executable

## Usage

The prebuilt binaries can be found in the Releases page, modules installed by
`npm` can be used directly in qode.

To package your Node.js project with qode, you should use [yackage][yackage].

Note that it is strong recommended to install the official Node.js with the
same version of qode, otherwise native modules installed by `npm` may not work
correctly in qode.

## Build

```bash
QT_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_qt_install_directory> TARGET_ARCH=[x64|ia32] HOST_ARCH=[x64|ia32] node ./build.js
```

TARGET_ARCH, HOST_ARCH and QT_INSTALL_DIR are optional

example:

For mac:

```bash
QT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.12.1 node build.js
```

For Linux:

```bash
QT_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_qt_install_dir>/5.12.4/gcc_64 node build.js`
```
